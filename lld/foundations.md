- Think like a system architect not a coder.
- Write scalable extensible maintainable code

OOPS, SOLID, YAGNI, KISS

Things to keep in Design
SOLID- Refer other file or Udemy

YAGNI - You ain't gonna need it, Focus on basic needs, don't go too overboard
KISS - Keep it Simple Stupid, Try to write simple code
Composition Over Inheritance – Prefer “has-a” over “is-a”.

Steps

- Ask a lot of questions and get clarity on requirements
- Find Actors, Entity, System Actions
- Draw Flow diagrams, Relation (has-a, is-a), Identify Design Patterns
- Think about edge-cases and concurrency-issues
- Implement code
- Test the code
- Optional(DB-schema design)

Tips

- Dont overthink, just write 0(n) code. Not a DSA problem
- You can always assume or simply complex logics for simplicity
- Always use interfaces for shared stuff/behaviour i.e, Votable, Commentable etc

Things to practice and Learn

- Java native objects, Collections
- DateTimeStuff
- Locks, Atomic Integer
- UUID Generate
- Random Number Generate
