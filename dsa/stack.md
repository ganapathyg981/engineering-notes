# Stack
- you keep items on top of each other and you always want the last updated element to be processed first
- you can push and pop/peek on a stack
- Last In, First Out (LIFO)
- BTW recursion uses stacks
## Intuition
- Balanced Parentheses / Matching Delimiters
- Evaluating Expressions (Postfix/Infix/Prefix)
