# Sliding window
- Substrings
- Continuous sub array
- Will have two pointers denoting start and end of window
- window maybe fixed or variable
- mostly move right and move left on condition
- you might also maintain a state right might increase and left will decrease both on condition
- conditions wil be both on window size and problem logic
## Problems
### Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 
### Longest Repeating Character Replacement 
### Minimum Window Substring
