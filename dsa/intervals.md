### Insert Intervals

- while you didnt reach any overlap, take stuff
- while you are between, scan throught and find the last high end and make a new interval
- while length is pending and intervals left, take them

### Merge interval
- Sort with lower number
- if prevend is greater than next start, merge it
### Minimum removals to make it non-overlapping
- Sort with lower number
- If conflicted, keep the earlier ending one and move ahead
