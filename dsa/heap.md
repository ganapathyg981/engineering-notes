# Heaps
- Can store a list of elements and balance itself and keep the highest or lowest weigh element of top
- You can have min or max heap
- You have to give a condition at init for weights
- in java you got PriorityQueue for heaps
## Intuition
- Top-K Elements or Minimum/Maximum Elements
- Efficient Minimum/Maximum Access
- Partial Sorting (dont need full sorted order but only the min or max)
- Priority Scheduling
- Merging Sorted Data (Merge k sorted linked lists into one sorted list)
