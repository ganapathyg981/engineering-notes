# LinkedList 
- Items are connected via pointers in random places
- You can only access in sequence, no random access like arrays
- Has Dynamic sizing unlike arrays

Techniques
- Mostly playing with pointers
- Getting to know the length might help
- Getting to know the middle with slow and fast pointer might help
- Practice reversing a linked list
- Sorting can be done with merge sort
- Cycles are detected with slow and fast pointer
- Double Linked List for LRU and LFU caches
