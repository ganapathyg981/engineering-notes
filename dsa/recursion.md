# Recursion 

## Basic Things
You will have these three things
- A condition to stop the recursion
- Calling recursion with smaller/cut inputs for all possible branches
- Perform the analysis you have to do either b4 or after the recursion call based on your needs
- After if you want to build from bottom up
- Before if you want to drill top down

## Top Down
info is passed from top to bottom
- you populate the base case and send it along down and return that shit
- first process then do recursive call


## Bottom Up
Info is passed from bottom up
- you build the base case at the return and build that up to output
- do recursive call get the result and process on the result
