# Object-Oriented Programming
 - ## Inheritance 
 - ## Encapsulation
    - Bundling of many things together to form a single unit, class - methods, vars
    - Restricting access too
    - Hiding 
 - ## Polymorphism
 - ## Abstraction

## Interfaces
  - cannot have member variables  
  - it can have methods abstract or default concrete methods which can be overridden
  - we can use them when we have variable algorithms of the same stuff (strategy pattern)
  - it can be a member of a class
