# Maintainability

The major cost off owning the software is not the infra but to maintain it
- fixing bugs
- keeping its systems operational
- investigating failures
- adapting it to new platforms
- modifying it for new use cases
- repaying technical debt
- adding new features.

Don't make your system a legacy shit system

## Operability
> good operations can often work around the limitations of bad (or
incomplete) software, but good software cannot run reliably with bad operations

## Simplicity
Simple to understand, use abstractions. Do all the
## Evolvability
System should be easy to change
