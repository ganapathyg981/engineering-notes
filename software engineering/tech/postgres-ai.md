# PostgreSQL - System Design & Architecture

## Core Concepts

### What is PostgreSQL?
- Advanced open-source relational database system
- Known for reliability, data integrity, and extensibility
- Supports complex queries, foreign keys, triggers, views
- Built with focus on standards compliance and extensibility
- Supports both SQL and JSON querying

### Architecture Components
1. **Process Model**
   - Multi-process architecture (not multi-threaded)
   - Each client connection gets a dedicated server process
   - Shared memory for inter-process communication
   - Background processes for maintenance tasks
   - Process types:
     - Postmaster (main process)
     - Backend processes (client connections)
     - Background workers
     - Background writer
     - Checkpointer
     - WAL writer
     - Autovacuum

2. **Memory Architecture**
   - Shared buffers (main memory cache)
   - Work memory (per-operation memory)
   - Maintenance work memory
   - WAL buffers
   - Memory contexts
   - Memory management strategies

3. **Storage Architecture**
   - Tablespaces
   - Heap files
   - TOAST (The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique)
   - Page structure (8KB blocks)
   - Storage manager layer

4. **Transaction Management**
   - MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)
   - Transaction isolation levels
   - Lock management
   - Deadlock detection
   - Transaction logging

## High-Level Design Considerations

### Scalability
1. **Vertical Scaling**
   - Increase server resources
   - Optimize memory settings
   - Tune query performance
   - Configure parallel query execution

2. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Read replicas
   - Sharding strategies
   - Partitioning
   - Connection pooling
   - Load balancing

### Performance Optimization
1. **Query Optimization**
   - Cost-based optimizer
   - Statistics collection
   - Index usage
   - Query planning
   - Execution plan analysis

2. **Resource Management**
   - Memory allocation
   - I/O optimization
   - Connection pooling
   - Background processes
   - Cache management

### Data Integrity & Reliability
1. **ACID Compliance**
   - Atomicity
   - Consistency
   - Isolation
   - Durability
   - Transaction management

2. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - WAL archiving
   - Physical backups
   - Logical backups
   - Replication

## Advanced Features

### Security
1. **Authentication**
   - Multiple authentication methods
   - SSL/TLS support
   - Password encryption
   - Role management
   - Access control

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Row-level security
   - Column-level security
   - Schema-level security
   - Audit logging

### Monitoring & Management
1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - pg_stat_statements
   - pg_stat_activity
   - System catalogs
   - Wait events
   - Custom monitoring

2. **Maintenance Tools**
   - VACUUM
   - ANALYZE
   - REINDEX
   - CLUSTER
   - CHECKPOINT

## Production Configuration Best Practices

### Memory Settings
```ini
# Shared Memory Settings
shared_buffers = 4GB
work_mem = 16MB
maintenance_work_mem = 1GB
effective_cache_size = 12GB

# WAL Settings
wal_buffers = 16MB
checkpoint_timeout = 5min
max_wal_size = 1GB
```

### Performance Settings
```ini
# Query Planning
random_page_cost = 1.1
effective_io_concurrency = 200
default_statistics_target = 100

# Connection Settings
max_connections = 200
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
```

## Common Interview Questions
