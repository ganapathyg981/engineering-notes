# Redis - System Design & Architecture

## Core Concepts

### What is Redis?
- In-memory data structure store
- Used as database, cache, message broker, and queue
- Supports various data structures (strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets)
- Built for high performance and atomic operations
- Single-threaded event loop architecture

### Architecture Components
1. **Core Components**
   - Redis Server
   - Redis Client
   - Redis Sentinel (high availability)
   - Redis Cluster (sharding)
   - Redis Modules (extensibility)

2. **Memory Management**
   - In-memory storage
   - Memory allocation
   - Memory fragmentation
   - Memory policies
   - Persistence options

3. **Data Structures**
   - Strings
   - Hashes
   - Lists
   - Sets
   - Sorted Sets
   - HyperLogLog
   - Bitmaps
   - Streams

4. **Event Loop**
   - Single-threaded model
   - Non-blocking I/O
   - Command processing
   - Pub/Sub system
   - Background tasks

## High-Level Design Considerations

### Scalability
1. **Vertical Scaling**

   - Key expiration
   - Memory management

### Data Persistence
1. **RDB (Redis Database)**
   - Point-in-time snapshots
   - Configuration options
   - Performance impact
   - Recovery process
   - Backup strategy

2. **AOF (Append Only File)**
   - Durability guarantees
   - Write performance
   - Recovery process
   - Rewrite process
   - Configuration options

## Advanced Features

### Security
1. **Authentication**
   - Password protection
   - ACL (Access Control Lists)
   - SSL/TLS support
   - Network security
   - Command filtering

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption at rest
   - Encryption in transit
   - Access control
   - Audit logging
   - Security best practices

### Monitoring & Management
1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - INFO command
   - MONITOR command
   - Slow log
   - Memory usage
   - Client connections

2. **Management Tools**
   - Redis CLI
   - Redis Commander
   - RedisInsight
   - Monitoring systems
   - Backup tools

## Production Configuration Best Practices

### Server Settings
```conf
# Memory Settings
maxmemory 2gb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
maxmemory-samples 10

# Persistence Settings
save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000
appendonly yes
appendfsync everysec

# Performance Settings
timeout 0
tcp-keepalive 300
maxclients 10000
```

### Client Settings
```conf
# Connection Settings
timeout 0
tcp-keepalive 300
maxclients 10000

# Security Settings
requirepass your_strong_password
rename-command FLUSHDB ""
rename-command FLUSHALL ""
```
